- **ORM**: GORM
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Architecture**: Clean Code Architecture

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for products.
- Clean and maintainable codebase following Clean Code principles.
- Supports concurrency for efficient data processing.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-product-api.git
cd crud-product-api
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your database and application settings:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=productdb
APP_PORT=8080
```

### 3. Build and Run Using Docker
#### Using Docker Compose:
1. Ensure `docker-compose.yml` is properly configured.
2. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Without Docker Compose:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t crud-product-api .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 crud-product-api
   ```

### 4. Run Locally Without Docker
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
3. The application will run at `http://localhost:8080`.
